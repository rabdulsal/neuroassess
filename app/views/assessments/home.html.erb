		<h2>Welcome to the Test site!</h2>

		<p>
			Ths site is intended as a test site for the Rush Neuro health and quality of life assessment forms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Depending on the device you're using (e.g. tablet, desktop, mobile phone, etc), you may see 3 small lines in the upper right corner. Clicking this icon will reveal links to various assessment forms.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the aid of rapid prototyping, each assessment form is constructed as a Google Form/Spreadsheet, which is readily accessible from any where there is an internet connection.
		</p>
		<p>
			The collection of forms and spreadsheets can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B5Cls7usCJOiMExXMW83SVVTZ0k/edit" target="_blank">here,</a> and each form has been populated with test data for example purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are currently no access permissions to aid easy example viewing, but password protections can easily be implemented as needed.
		</p>
